# Project Initiative

### Plant Monitoring

The project consists of a mobile application that will allow users to take advantage of the ability of artificial intelligence to recognize types of plants, as well as provide advice related to plant health, care, diseases and uses. The application must allow the user:
 - Using the device's camera
 - Being able to create “collections” to store specific plants

### The Scenarios to Solve:
The application will allow the user to identify the medicinal properties of plants, providing recipes for the creation of healing ointments, concoctions and purifiers for the environment.
 - It is the team's job to decide if they will design their interfaces for mobile or desktop.
 - Each team must choose the representative name of their app/site.

# Strategy

The Strategy plane is the first stage in the Elements of User Experience, and it seeks to align the goals of both the application owners and the users.

In this context, the Value Proposition Canvas is critical for understanding our target audience's goals and needs. It assists us in determining what consumers hope to achieve with our solution and how we can best meet their goals.

# Solutions Scope

The Solutions Scope assists in identifying interested users by specifying our product's target demographic and specific features. It allows us to efficiently modify our product to match their demands and focus our efforts on recruiting and maintaining the correct users.

# Benchmark

By researching other applications, benchmarking allows us to better our product. It reveals best practices, user expectations, and market trends. We can raise the bar, differentiate ourselves, and improve our design and user experience by learning from successful applications.

# Customer Journey Map

The Customer Journey Map is an extremely useful tool for comprehending user experience. It charts each interaction step, showing emotions, needs, and important moments. This research identifies possibilities to improve the experience and develop unique solutions. We create memorable experiences and establish relationships by immersing ourselves in the world of the user.

# Wireframe

Wireframes are essential for visualizing product structure and layout in design. They help to explain user interactions and spot problems early on. Wireframes enable us to confidently develop intuitive and user-centered experiences by shortening the design process and enabling collaboration.
